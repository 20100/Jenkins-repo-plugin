Future features roadmap (Mostly from Sony Ericson)

Roughly in order of priority.  I have no solid plans to work on any of these,
but if you'd like to make any contributions, this list is a good place to
start!

Investigate usage of ToolInstaller
Wipe workspace option? (Follow git plugin here)
Badge/Tag support

Gerrit-Download integration (Gerrit Trigger plugin support)
Better auto-retry logic
Custom/Local manifest uploaded via UI

Specify manifest name (-m option)
Support smartsync (-s option)
Support repo mirrors
Support fetching on multiple repo threads
